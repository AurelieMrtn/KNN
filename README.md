# IA Classification Challenge 2022

## Overview
This project is part of an AI classification challenge that involves implementing and testing the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm on a new anonymized dataset. The goal is to develop a classification model that accurately predicts binary class labels (0 or 1).

## Challenge Structure
The challenge consists of three phases:
1. **Training Phase**:
   - A dataset (`data.txt`) is provided.
   - It contains **10 input variables** and **one qualitative output variable**.
   - The dataset includes **1000 examples** belonging to **two classes (0 or 1)**.
   - Participants can split the data into **training and test sets** to optimize their model.

2. **Pre-Test Phase**:
   - A second dataset (`preTest.txt`) will be provided later.
   - This dataset is used to validate the model and ensure everything functions correctly.

3. **Final Test Phase**:
   - The final dataset (`finalTest.txt`) will be given.
   - It follows the same structure as `data.txt`, but **the target variable is missing**.
   - The trained model must predict the class label for each instance.
